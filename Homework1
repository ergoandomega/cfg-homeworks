TASK 1

Write a class to represent a Cash Register.
You class should keep the state of price total and purchased items

Below is a starter code:
------------------------
1. you can add new variables and function if you want to
2. you will NEED to add accepted method parameters where required.
For example, method add_item probably accepts some kind of an item?..
3. You will need to write some examples of how your code works.

class CashRegister:

    def __init__(self):

        self.total_price = 0

    def add_item(self):
        pass

    def remove_item(self):

TASK 2

Write a base class to represent a student. Below is a starter code. 
Feel free to add any more new features to your class. 
As a minimum a student has a name and age and a unique ID.

Create a new subclass from student to represent a concrete student doing a specialization, for example:
Software Student and Data Science student. 

"""


class Student:

    def __init__(self, name, age, id):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.id = id
        self.subjects = dict()


# class CFGStudent(<should inherit from Student>)
#     create new methods that manage student's subects (add/remove new subject and its graade to the dict)
#     create a method to view all subjects taken by a student
#     create a method  (and a new variable) to get student's overall mark (use average)
